# sudoku-generator
Sudoku puzzle generator.
Written in Python with matplotlib for esthetics; the program creates a ready-to-solve Sudoku puzzle with maximum amount of empty cells. 

Please take note: it is not interactive - you will see just an image of a sudoku puzzle that you can save and print for example.
